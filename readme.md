# Plugin Pixolin Dir-Listing

User has sampled some files in a subdirectory of `wp-content/uploads`, which he wants to share on his website. More files will be added randomly.

This plugin creates a shortcode `[dirlisting name="{subdirectory}"]`, where the user can specify a subdirectory of `wp-content/uploads`, e.g. `[dirlisting name="mydocuments"]`. The shortcode function reads the content of the given subdirectory and renders them as links to the files in an unordered list.
